Overview
--------

This repository represents my vim config files/plugins from various operating
systems (represented by branches).  Included (at least when I wrote this readme)
is my configuration file for vim (vimrc), as well as all my plugins,
colorschemes, and other vim files

Use
---

I create symlinks for all my configuration files which point to my local clone
of this repository.  I find this to be the best way, because after some fairly
simple setup, it's virtually seamless, and fairly pain-free to keep it up to
date.  Checkout one of the platform-specific branches for more platform-specific
information.

License
-------

Feel free to use any of the content to add to your own vim configuration, or even
to just fork my repository and make your own it your own.  My only request is
that you send me a link with your new fork, so I can check out what you do
differently.  I love tinkering with vim, and am very interested in how other
people configure their vim.

Comments/Questions/Criticism
----------------------------

I'm always looking for cool new ideas of things to add to my configuration
files.  I'm a born tinkerer, and often spend more time configuring vim than
actually working in it.  =P  So please use the issue tracker to suggest things I
could add to my configuration files, or feel free to submit pull requests if you
fork the repository.  Enjoy!  =)
