# SSH

# SSH shortcutting -- need to change this to the hosts file
#   Might be undercutting the safety measure of changing my default ssh port by
#   posting these, but at least it still wards off some automated attacks, and
#   with the other security measures I have in place, I'm just not worried
#   about it. =P
