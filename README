This repo represents my config files from various operating systems (represented
by branches).  Included (at least when I wrote this readme) are my config
files for zsh and vim, as well as all my plugins and colorschemes from vim.

Feel free to use any of the content to add to your own .vimrc or .zshrc.  Note,
however, that my .zshrc is designed to be used with oh-my-zsh, and the
defined colorscheme is not included in the default oh-my-zsh install.  I need
to put some finishing touches on it and then send a pull request to have it
included in oh-my-zsh.  Or maybe I'll just add it to this repo.

In any case, feel free to ask questions or comment on anything here!  =)
