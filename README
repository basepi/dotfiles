Overview
--------

This repository represents my config files from various operating systems
(represented by branches).  Included (at least when I wrote this readme) are my
config files for zsh and vim, as well as all my plugins, colorschemes, and other
files from vim.

Use
---

I create symlinks for all my configuration files which point to my local clone
of this repository.  I find this to be the best way, because after some fairly
simple setup, it's virtually seamless, and fairly pain-free to keep it up to
date.  Checkout one of the platform-specific branches for more platform-specific
information.

License
-------

Feel free to use any of the content to add to your own .vimrc or .zshrc, or even
to just fork my repository and make your own.  Note, however, that my .zshrc is
designed to be used with oh-my-zsh, and the defined theme is not included in the
default oh-my-zsh install.  I need to put some finishing touches on it and then
send a pull request to have it included in oh-my-zsh.  Or maybe I'll just add it
to this repo.

Comments/Questions/Criticism
----------------------------

I'm always looking for cool new ideas of things to add to my configuration
files.  I'm a born tinkerer, and often spend more time configuring vim than
actually working in it.  =P  So please use the issue tracker to suggest things I
could add to my configuration files, or feel free to submit pull requests if you
fork the repository.  Enjoy!  =)
